In java  primitive are stored in stack memory and non primitive(objects) are stored in heap memory means objects are in heap 
and veriable are in stack but in python each and every thing is object so all stored in heap memory 

for using integer as a object we are uing wrapper class like (Integer a = new Integer(5))
so now a is treated as object and we are able to perform many object related operation or we can say
many methods in int type veriable . 

in short The primary purpose of wrapper classes is to bridge the gap between primitive types and
 the object-oriented nature of Java.



 internally prinln call the toString methods for converting any value to object


 + operator in java we can only use with primitive and we can use with all complex as well 
 but only one condition is at least on of these object is should be type String
